ToDo:
1. build graph in pyg format
    1.1 adj matrix
    1.2 heterogenous
    1.3 extend to other data sources
2. metrics
    2.1 classification: acc, f1
    2.2 rank: ndcg, mrr, hit@10
    2.3 return: sharpe ratio, irr
3. LSTM & self-attention baseline
4. GCN & GAT baseline
5. RGCN baseline

Analysis:
1. temporal variability and temporal sparsity
    1.1 node cnt/degree variation

Ideas:
1. data imputation: eg. GRU-D, attention mask
2. LSTM gate with GNN
3. correlation as edges (long term relationship?)
4. gating
5. long term vs. short term event
    5.1 events as node feature
    5.2 events as stock context
6. constraints between neighbouring timestamps
7. edges: sector, fund holding, corr, 

Comp:
1. MLP, LSTM, GCN, GAT, HAN
2. StockRank, HyperStockGAT

Writing:
1. market efficiency hypothesis
2. research problems and how they are solved
3.
